      <p class="text-lg">
        At Noah’s Ark Shelter, our mission is to provide a safe, nurturing, and compassionate haven for abandoned, abused, and homeless animals. We are committed to rescuing animals in distress, offering them medical care, rehabilitation, and a temporary home until they find their forever families. Beyond rescue efforts, we strive to educate the community about responsible pet ownership, the importance of spaying and neutering, and the need to combat animal cruelty. Our mission is driven by empathy, hope, and the unwavering belief that every animal deserves a second chance at life — a chance to be loved, protected, and cherished.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Vision</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Our vision is to create a world where no animal suffers from neglect or abuse — a future where every animal, regardless of its past, has the opportunity to live a safe, healthy, and happy life. We envision Noah’s Ark Shelter as not just a refuge for animals but as a beacon of change within the community — inspiring kindness, promoting adoption over purchasing pets, and fostering a culture of compassion. We aim to build strong partnerships with volunteers, veterinarians, and advocates to expand our reach and impact, ensuring that one day, every stray and abandoned animal finds a place they can call home.
